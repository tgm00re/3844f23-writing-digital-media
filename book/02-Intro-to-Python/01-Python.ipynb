    "\n",
    "As a good primer on the subject, Miriam Posner, a professor of DH and information studies at UCLA, wrote an excellent blog post about why people should think before they [\"exhort everyone to code.\"](https://miriamposner.com/blog/some-things-to-think-about-before-you-exhort-everyone-to-code/). Posner discusses that certain kinds of people, like middle-class white men, are more likely to be exposed to programming languages at a young age and are less likely to experience sexism and racism while learning programming languages. \"Programming knowledge is not a neutral thing,\" she argues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aside**: Posner's post is a good start to recognize these issues aroung \"coding literacy.\" If you curious about other researchers and works on these matters, check out these folks referenced by the national Special Interest Group (SIG) that I chair: [SIGWROC](https://wroc.netlify.app/bibliography/) (SIG on the Writing and Rhetoric of Code). With regards to coding literacy, definitely check out Annette Vee, Antonio Byrd, Ashley Rea, and even yours truly `:-)`.\n",
